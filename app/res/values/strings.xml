    <!--<string name="title">Mego Coin:</string>
    <string name="description_1">Mego Coin is one of our MegoGrid module which helps you to unlock the premium features of your app using virtual currency.</string>
    <string name="description_2">It manages three types of purchase e.g.  permanent (one time), partial, or subscription. Below are their brief explanation:</string>
    <string name="title_permanent">Permanent:</string>
    <string name="permanent_description">This  purchase helps your app user to unlock the permium feature for ever. That means once they unlock any premium feature of your application user will able to use it forever.</string>
    <string name="title_charge">Partial:</string>

    <string name="title_subscription">Subscription:</string>
    <string name="subscription_description">This purchase helps your app user to unlock the premium feature on subscription based just like we subscribe news letter and pay regular amount for that subscription. If user don\'t want to continue with the subscription he has to cancel it by sending a cancellation request.</string>-->


    <string name="title">Mego Pro:</string>
    <string name="description_1">Mego Pro is one of our MegoGrid module which helps you to integrate validation on your premium features that should be accessed
    in a limited way. Unlike giving complete and free access to a feature you can use this module to provide limited access to them
    and probe user to unlock it for its pro version. </string>
    <string name="description_2">This module provides six types of validations which are as follows:</string>
    <string name="title_permanent">Trial Days Access:</string>
    <string name="permanent_description">This validation  provides access to a feature for limited number of days. Once those days expired user will be prompted with \'Trial expired. All
    pro features are locked. Unlock it to use further.\'</string>
    <string name="title_charge">Count Usage Access:</string>
    <string name="partial_description">This validation provides access to a feature with specified number of clicks. If user exceed the clicks it will be locked
     and he has to unlock/buy it.</string>
    <string name="title_subscription">Trial Days + Count Usage:</string>
    <string name="subscription_description">This validation is the combination of above to validation types. Rest other things are same.</string>
    <string name="maxAccess">Max Concurrent Access:</string>
    <string name="maxDefinition">This validation is used for the feature in your application which you have represented to the user in form
    of selection, where user can select as many as s/he can and then perform a single common operation on those selected items.
    Example of such representation is check boxes that you might have used in selecting images from Gallery or your custom selection
    of items where you want a common operation on them. This validation types has two subparts as follows:</string>

    <string name="maxRecurrence">Max Concurrent-Recurrence:</string>
    <string name="recurrenceDefinition">Considering the above Concurrent Access scenario let us assume that we have maximum access of three
    items(3) for the given day. So according to the concurrent-Recurrence validation each time user will access the items within the limit of
    maximum access s/he is left with the total access minus the used items for the given day. And once he used all the maximum items
    access  provided for the given day s/he can\'t access further any items for that day and can only access again on next day.</string>

    <string name="maxNonrecurrence">Max Concurrent-NonRecurrence:</string>
    <string name="nonrecurrenceDefinition">This validation is same as the Concurrent Recurrence. The only difference between this
    validation and above one is that user can use the maximum item provided at a time not more than that. That means s/he can use
    the given feature multiple times but maximum items at a time.</string>

    <string name="maxIndividual">Max Individual:</string>
    <string name="individualDefinition">This validation is used for the feature in your app which has list of items that you
    show to the user either by using a ListView or GridView. Suppose you have N number of items in a list and you want to restrict
    the access of items to allow user to see only limited ones from the top-down manner. So here comes the rescue, this is the
    validation which will helps you.</string>
